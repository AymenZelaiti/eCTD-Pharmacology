# eCTD-Pharmacology
Electronic Common Technical Document.
This project is a migration of a Windows Form application to ASP.NET Web Forms.

* What is eCTD:
The eCTD format is a specific electronic submission format for applications connected with medicinal product authorizations. It optimizes the management of medicinal product dossiers and their lifecycle. eCTD is based on the definition of the Common Technical Document (CTD) with its 5 modules and the technical specification V3.2.2 of the ICH (International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use). Module 1 is regional, while Modules 2-5 are harmonized internationally.

* Great THANKS To :
Ymir Vesteinsson , author of ects.is , the WinForms version of this application.
